# Valentin-Beaufays.github.io
This is my personal page repository. I build it to introduce me and expose my work to my client.
I think it as a one page website with four section: 
- header
- presentation(comming soon..)
- professional experience(comming soon..)
- portofolio(comming soon..)

## Header

The header is a fullscreen background with an introdutction and the links to my social networks.
The background is applied to the body and fixed to the screen in order to be able to move the other sections up and hide the background.
